# Fruit-detection-and-classification-
The project utilizes a Python-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for fruit detection and classification. It focuses on classifying fruits into 3 categories and distinguish them as FRESH or ROTTEN fruits in images through image processing. It aims for high accuracy, showing promising results for practical use.
